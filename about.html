		   <p>There are many types of music, including popular music, traditional music, art music, music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such as chanteys.Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).</p>


			<p>This is Herman Brooks. Herman is just like the rest of us. Everyday he has to make all kinds of decisions like what to wear, whom to date and when to panic. Now these decisions should be easy but if you take a look inside Herman's head, you'll see why he sometimes has trouble making up his mind. Sometimes they agree... usually they don't. But the struggle is going on inside all of us and it's all going on inside Herman's head.</p>

			<p>Once upon a time there were three little girls who went to the police academy. Two in Los Angeles. The other in San Francisco. And they were each assigned very hazardous duties. But I took them away from all that. And now they work for me. My name is Charlie.></p>

			<p>Well we're movin' on up, to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the sky. Movin' on up, To the east side. We finally got a piece of the pie. Fish don't fry in the kitchen, beans don't burn on the grill. Took a whole lotta tryin' just to get up that hill. Now we're up in the big leagues, gettin' our turn at bat. As long as we live, it's you and me baby, There ain't nothin' wrong with that. Well we're movin' on up, to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the sky. Movin' on up, to the east side. We finally got a piece of the pie.</p>

			<p>music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., dancing) and cultural activities ranging from amateur karaoke singing to playing in an amateur funk band or singing in a community choir. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra, or work as a professional musician or singer.</p>
			
			<p>In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups. The police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories.</p>
